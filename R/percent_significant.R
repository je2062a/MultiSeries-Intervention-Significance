#' percent_significant
#' 
#' Calculates the percentage of time-series that experienced significant change 
#' due to an intervention.
#'  
#' This function provides simple analysis of multiple time-series data sets. The
#' function can read time-series data that has already been fitted to an 
#' "intervention at t = 0" format, or unformatted data by including a data set 
#' that inlcudes the time of intervention. The output of this function
#' represents the percent of individual time-series that experienced a 
#' significant difference between pre-intervention and post-intervention data.
